# enforcing-convensional-commit

> a minimum tool for enforcing your repository to hook conventional commits at git commit.

## useage

`npm i enforcing-convensional-commit -D`

You can enforce developpers to install the git-hook script if you follow the above way at executing general script `npm install`.

Note that if user choose to install a single dependency,  
the auto-process will not work.

Alternatively,  
you can install the git-hook script by just running sh script directly from web:  
`source < (curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yabe-diverta/enforcing-convensional-commit/main/install)`
